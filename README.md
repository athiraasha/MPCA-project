<h3>Password based door lock system using arduino</h3>
<h6>objective: To provide enough security to users to gain access into the concerned place bounded by the door lock and to prevent from unauthorized users access. </h6>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Password based door lock system using Arduino UNO is a project where a secure password will act as a door unlocking system. Traditional lock systems using mechanical lock and key mechanism are being replaced by new advanced techniques of locking system. These techniques are an integration of mechanical and electronic devices and are highly intelligent. One of the prominent features of these innovative lock systems is their simplicity and high efficiency. Such an automatic lock system consists of electronic control assembly, which controls the output load through a password. This output load can be a motor or a lamp, or any other mechanical or electrical load. Here, we develop an electronic code lock system using Arduino UNO which provides control for actuating the load. This system demonstrates a password-based door lock system using Arduino UNO, wherein once the correct code or password is entered, the door is opened and the concerned person is allowed access to the secured area. Again, if another person arrives, it will ask to enter the password if the password is wrong, then door would remain closed, denying access to the person.</p>
